**Alignment**

Alignment is a key factor in this game. When you begin the game, you start with zero alignment. You can click on your race's Headquarters and choose to "become a Deputy". In doing this, you gain 150 alignment. You need at least 150 alignment to buy Federal ships, or -150 to purchase Underground ships. Your alignment will go up and down throughout the game and can be difficult to maintain a positive alignment. Some players Opt to "Go Evil". Going evil requires a negative alignment of atleast -150. Some players will tell you that going evil is more difficult of a task, as when you are trading illegal goods you take the chance of being caught. When you get caught, depending on how many holds of what item you have, it costs you money. Your alignment goes down further and faster this way, but requires a lot of money to do so.

Alignment also plays a role in how many weapons you may safely have on your ship and still have Federal protection. Below is a simple chart to help you determine whether or not you will be protected in Fed space.

If your alignment is between +750 or higher, your attack rating can be 8/ in Fed Space. If your alignment is between +600 to +749, your attack rating can be 7/ in Fed Space. If your alignment is between +450 to +599, your attack rating can be 6/ in Fed Space. If your alignment is between +300 to +449, your attack rating can be 5/ in Fed Space. If your alignment is between +150 to +299, your attack rating can be 4/. If your alignment is between -149 to +149, your attack rating can be 3/. If your alignment is between -150 to -299, your attack rating can be 2/. If your alignment is is between -300 to -449, your attack rating can be 1/ in Fed Space. If your alignment is -300 or lower, your attack rating can be 0/. But remember, you can NEVER be protected in fed space while you have illegal goods in your cargo holds
