**Federal Protection**

A player can log off safely when they are under Federal Protection. Federal Protection is provided through friendly Federation beacons **beacon.gif**. Now then, just because you are in a Fed zone does not mean you are automatically protected. The Federation will not protect any traders that have illegal goods on board their ship. So if you trade in slave, weapons, or narcotics, make sure your holds are empty of these items before logging off in Fed.

Another overlooked cause of death in Fed zones is your attack rating being higher than what your alignment will allow protection for. Here is a simple chart that outlines what your attack rating can be for each level of alignment:

If your alignment is +750 or higher, your attack rating can be 8/ in Fed Space. If your alignment is between +600 to +749, your attack rating can be 7/. If your alignment is between +450 to +599, your attack rating can be 6/. If your alignment is between +300 to +449, your attack rating can be 5/. If your alignment is between +150 to +299, your attack rating can be 4/. If your alignment is between -149 to +149, your attack rating can be 3/. If your alignment is between -150 to -299, your attack rating can be 2/. If your alignment is between -300 to -449, your attack rating can be 1/. If your alignment is -300 or lower, your attack rating can be 0/. But remember, you can NEVER be protected in fed space while you have illegal goods in your cargo holds

As you can tell, traders that have deputized are able to keep more weapons on board, while those traders that have joined the underground must sell off the majority of their weapons in ORDER to take advantage of Federal Protection. If you are in doubt as to whether or not you are protected, before logging out of the game, click on 'Trader' on the left side of your screen and CHECK your status. If you are protected, you will see a message letting you know that you are under Federal Protection. If not, double CHECK for illegal goods or too many weapons on your ship.
