**Combat**

Fighting is one of the most adrenaline-filled events you can find in SMR. While the most intense fighting can be found against another online ship, joining with other people attacking planets and ports also carry their own thrill. Read on to learn more about the similarities and differences of fighting in SMR.


**Ship to Ship**
Most combat in a game is performed between two fleets of ship. The simplest one involves one player attacking another. The outcome of these one-on-one fights depends partly on ship choice, weapons, and how quickly a player can click attack or run away. The odds of hitting an opponent with a weapon depends on your level, the level of the person you are attacking, and the base accuracy on the weapon. A player with more experience will be more accurate than a player with less experience. The same idea applies to combat drones. The more experience a player has, the more likely they are to launch greater numbers of combat drones at an enemy. The current combat code can be found here.

When multiple ships from the same alliance are in the same sector, they will fire as a fleet. In a fleet fight, a trigger by a single player results in the firing of several ships. Currently the maximum number of players that will fire per trigger is two. This means that if you and two alliance mates are in a sector and you fire on an enemy ship, only one of your allies will be included in your shot. This is why it is beneficial to have everyone in the sector firing.

When your ship is attacked, it will return fire automatically (as long as you have something to return fire with!). Just like attacking, the maximum number of players that can be fired on with a single trigger is two.

Ship to ship combat requires practice. Different players use different strategies and weapons configurations. Try asking different players in the game what they use. Most players are more than willing to help out curious, new player.

**Planets**
Planets are located in the outer galaxies, occasionally you can find planets in racial galaxies. They are places to park ships, stockpile trade goods, and store cash. A player may take ownership of a planet and set a password so that other players in their alliance cannot take it. Only players from the owner's alliance may land on the planet. All others must attack and destroy a planet's defenses before landing. Once a planet's defenses are destroyed, a player can land and take ownership of the planet.

Planets start out with no buildings at all, but with proper supplies stockpiled, construction of generators, hangars, and turrets can begin. As more buildings are constructed, the planet's defense level increases. Planets begin at level zero and finish at level 70.

Generators protect a planet with shields. Each generator can hold 100 shields and planets can have a maximum of 100 generators, or 10,000 shields.

Hangars house and launch combat drones. Each hangar holds 20 drones and planets can have a maximum of 100 hangars, or 2,000 CDs.

Turrets fire heavy laser beams. Each planet can have a maximum of 10 turrets. These laser beams do 250/250 damage. Basically, when they fire at someone they can destroy 250 shields, or 250 armor (but not both on the same shot).

**Bunkers...(info on bunkers goes here)**

The construction center shows what goods are stockpiled on a planet and which ones are needed for building each type of defense. Once started, it shows when construction will be completed. Only one building can be constructed at a time.

Some planets have a bank vault which can store cash. The vault can be accessed by anyone who is parked on the planet. The vault can also be used to bond cash. A bond cannot be touched once it has started and will pay interest on the principal amount when it comes due.

Planets can serve as a relatively safe place to park your ship, but no planet is 100% safe and even level 45 planets can fall to a well organized attacking fleet of warships.

**Ports**
Ports are places where goods are bought and sold for various prices. Players gain money and experience by bargaining with port masters for the best possible price. Ports are ranked from level 1 to level 9. Low level ports sell cheaper goods, while high level ports sell more expensive and more profitable goods. Some ports sell illegal goods too, but these can only be traded by those traders who have joined the UnderGround and are of evil alignment.

In the example shown below, the port is a level 8 port that buys food, precious metals (pm), textiles, circuitry, and weapons (an illegal good), and it sells wood, ore, slaves (an illegal good), machinery, luxuries, and narcotics (an illegal good). You cannot see illegal goods unless your alignment is below -99. Being evil provides both advantages and disadvantages, such as more goods trade, thus more routes but if you are caught trading an illegal good then you will be fined.

~~**A sample port can be found here in the SMR Manual.**~~

Trading at a port is done by clicking the TRADE button and bargaining with the port master. Tips on trading can be found elsewhere in this manual, or by asking a fellow player who has learned the ropes.

Ports can also be raided by clicking the RAID button, but be warned: ports are heavily defended by a dozen laser turrets and thousands of combat drones. Only a fleet of well-armed warships can hope to raid a port successfully, but the payoff is often worth the risk.
