<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Combat -->

Fighting is one of the most adrenaline-filled events you can find in SMR. While the most intense fighting can be found against another online ship, joining with other people attacking planets and ports also carry their own thrill. Read on to learn more about the similarities and differences of fighting in SMR.

# Ship to Ship
Most combat in a game is performed between two fleets of ship. The simplest one involves one player attacking another. The outcome of these one-on-one fights depends partly on ship choice, weapons, [experience level](https://www.smrealms.de/level_requirements.php), and how quickly a player can click attack or run away. The odds of hitting an opponent with a weapon depends on your level, the level of the person you are attacking, and the base accuracy on the weapon. A player with more experience will be more accurate than a player with less experience. The same idea applies to combat drones. The more experience a player has, the more likely they are to launch greater numbers of combat drones at an enemy. The current combat code can be found here.

When multiple ships from the same alliance are in the same sector, they will fire as a fleet. In a fleet fight, a trigger by a single player results in the firing of several ships. Currently the maximum number of players that will fire per trigger is 10.

When your ship is attacked, it will return fire automatically (as long as you have something to return fire with!). Just like attacking, the maximum number of players that can be fired on with a single trigger is 10.

Ship to ship combat requires practice. Different players use different strategies and weapon configurations. Try asking other players in the game what they use. Most players are more than willing to help out curious, new players.

# Planets
This section is about attacking planets. For general information about planets, see [Locations: Planets](locations#planets). 

| Types of planets |

| Terran |

| Arid |

Planets start out with no buildings at all, but with proper supplies stockpiled, construction of generators, hangars, and turrets can begin. As more buildings are constructed, the planet's defense level increases. 

* **Generators** protect a planet with shields. Each generator can hold 100 shields.
* **Hangars** house and launch combat drones. Each hangar holds 20 drones.
* **Turrets** fire heavy laser beams. Each planet can have a maximum of 10 turrets. These laser beams do 250/250 damage. Basically, when they hit an attacking ship they can destroy 250 shields or 250 armor (but not both on the same shot).
* **Bunkers** protect a planet with heavy-plated armor. Each bunker provides 100 armor.

The construction center shows what goods are stockpiled on a planet and which ones are needed for building each type of defense. Once started, it shows when construction will be completed. Only one building can be constructed at a time.

Planets can serve as a relatively safe place to park your ship, but no planet is 100% safe. Even the strongest planet can can fall to a well organized attacking fleet of warships.

# Ports
TODO: only the combat aspects of ports should be here.

Ports are places where goods are bought and sold for various prices. Players gain money and experience by bargaining with port masters for the best possible price. Ports are ranked from level 1 to level 9. Low level ports sell cheaper goods, while high level ports sell more expensive and more profitable goods. Some ports sell illegal goods too, but these can only be traded by those traders who have joined the Underground.

In the example shown below, the port is a level 8 port that buys food, precious metals (pm), textiles, circuitry, and weapons (an illegal good), and it sells wood, ore, slaves (an illegal good), machinery, luxuries, and narcotics (an illegal good). You cannot see illegal goods unless your alignment is below -99. Being evil provides both advantages and disadvantages, such as more goods trade, thus more routes but if you are caught trading an illegal good then you will be fined.

~~**A sample port can be found here in the SMR Manual.**~~

Trading at a port is done by clicking the TRADE button and bargaining with the port master. Tips on trading can be found elsewhere in this manual, or by asking a fellow player who has learned the ropes.

Ports can also be raided by clicking the RAID button, but be warned: ports are heavily defended by a dozen laser turrets and thousands of combat drones. Only a fleet of well-armed warships can hope to raid a port successfully, but the payoff is often worth the risk.
