<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Game Terms -->

**Alignment**
Alignment is a positive or negative number that shows a player's tendency to be good or evil or neutral. Good or evil players get access to special weapons and other benefits. Alignment changes go up or down depending on your actions in the game. Attacking players or ports of your own race or ones friendly to your race will lower your alignment. Attacking players or ports that your race is at war with will raise your alignment. Trading evil goods can lower alignment if caught, 5 points for being caught. Trading neutral goods and getting searched will raise your alignment 1 point. 

**Alliance**
Players can join together to form alliances. The benefits of being in an alliance are many, including sharing cash and other resources, mutual protection, and the fact that alliance ships can attack and defend together when they are in the same sector.

**Armor**
The armor plating that protects a ship and adds to its defense rating. When a ship's armor is reduced to zero, it is destroyed. Armor is purchased at the UNO shop.

**Attack Rating**
The strength of a ship's attack on other ships during battle. Having many strong weapons make for a higher and more effective attack rating.

**Bank**
Banks hold credits for players in one of several accounts. Every player has a personal bank account they can use. Alliances have a shared bank account. Anonymous bank accounts are also available and are password protected. Hunters often attack the unwary trader at banks, so be careful.

**Bounties**
When a player kills another player, a bounty can be placed on his head by either the Federal Government or the Underground. Killing a player who has a bounty entitles the winner to collect the bounty. Federal bounties can be claimed at any friendly racial head quarters and UG bounties can be claimed at the Underground.

**Builder**
The general term for players who work to build up a planet's construction level.

**Cargo Holds**
Cargo holds on a ship are used to carry goods from place to place. Most ships have cargo holds.

**CIJSD**
This indicator tells what hardware is present on a ship. Some hardware can only be installed on certain ships. The letters stand for the type of hardware: C=Cloaking Device, I=Illusion Generator, J=Jump Drive, S=Scanner, D=Drone Scrambler.

**Cloaking Device**
Hardware installed on a ship that allows it to become invisible to players who are the same level or lower. A cloaked ship will appear as an unidentified or phantom trader if it is the only ship in the sector. If there is more than one uncloaked ship in the sector it will dispappear completely from view to those of lower level than the cloaker. Higher level pilots can always see through the cloak. The cloak deactivates when the cloaker initiates an attack or hits a mine.

**Combat Accessories (CA)**
The shop that sells mines, combat drones, and scout drones.

**Combat Drones (CD's)**
Combat drones can be carried onboard ships and placed in sectors. They increase a ship's rating, and can both attack and defend in battle. When placed in a sector with other forces, they protect the stack by returning fire when the stack is attacked.

**Combat Rating**
This is how you determine the offence and defensive strength of your ship. This rating is displayed in the right panel under your type. It is illustrated as "Rating: Attack Rating/Defense Rating". Defense rating is calculated based on the combined total of your shields and armor / 100. For example; An Eater of Souls (Salvene Racial ship) has 1050 shields and 950 armor this results in a /20 defense rating. Offencive rating is calculated by combining the total damage for all weapons and dividing by 40. For Example; Using a Eater of Souls again, fully armed with 5 weapons has a total damage of 450 shield, 800 armor. Using the formula Attack+Damage/40, we get a result of 31.25, this result is the rounded down to 31.

**Combat Round**
How battles are fought against forces, players, ports and planets. The attacker fires first and the defender automatically counter attacks. Each combat round costs the attacker three turns.

**Credits**
The currency used in SMR to buy items. Cash is most often earned by trading at ports or destroying other players' ships and keeping the cash it had onboard at the time. Keeping cash in the bank is a wise idea. Credits, however, are not to be confused with SMR Credits

**Defense Rating**
The strength of a ship's defense against attack in terms of shields, armor, and combat drones. The more shields, armor, and combat drones a ship has, the higher the defense rating.

**Demand**
The supply of goods available at a port goes down as traders buy and sell it and is restored over time or by the trade of lower classed goods. A low supply number means a higher buy/sell price for the trader.

**Deputy**
Becoming a deputy at racial head quarters raises a pilot's alignment to 150 points. This is the opposite of becoming a gang member at the Underground.

**Drone Scrambler**
Hardware installed on a ship that scrambles the targeting system of enemy combat drones and reduces the amount of damage done to the ship.

**Experience**
Points earned or lost during the game. Experience is gained for trading and destroying forces and killing other pilots. Players lose experience points when the ship he is flying is destroyed. Players start with zero experience and can reach 500,000 points. A list of all levels can be found here: https://www.smrealms.de/level_requirements.php

**Evil**
An alignment lower than -99 means that a player is Evil. Evil players are allowed to use special weapons, trade in illegal goods, and collect Underground bounties. If a random search by the Federal Government finds illegal goods on a ship, the goods are confiscated and the pilot gets a cash fine and an alignment decrease of 5 points.

**Federal Government**
The Federation still has power in some things. It conducts random searches at ports for illegal goods. Areas of space are protected by the Federal government and are safe to park as long as a ship rating is at an acceptable level. Generally a player with an attack rating of 3 or less can park safely under Federal protection. The Trader screen (accessed by the Trader link) will show whether your ship is under protection or not.

**Forces**

The remaining two types of galaxies are "Neutral" which as its name implies is the space (typically) between racial. "Planet" galaxies make up the third type of galaxy. In this type of galaxy you will typically find planets and/or ports. This is the type of galaxy you find alliances setting up and establishing there 'home base'. Galaxies are connected via warps which use 5 turns to travel threw.

Port raids lower a player's personal relations with the port owner's race. There is no maximum personal relations, however they will increase very slowly after the first 500. When you reach a combined total of 1000 it means that negotiation at the port is not necessary- the price offered for the goods is always the best for experience, it takes 2000 for profit however.

**Planet**
Planets are scattered throughout the universe, usually in non-racial galaxies, and can be used as a landing area. Players build generators, hangars, and turrets as defenses against attack. Planets begin at a construction level of 0.00. As constuction develops, the level increases to a maximum of level 45.00.

**Port**
The place where traders can buy and sell goods for cash and experience. Ports are controlled by one of the eight races or they can be neutral. Neutral ports sell goods to all races regardless of the politics of war or peace. Ports are ranked by level from 1 to 9. Level 1 ports sell few goods and have weak defenses against attack. Level 9 ports sell the topmost goods and are protected from attack by heavy shields, multiple laser turrets, and hundreds of combat drones. When one or more traders attack a port, it is called a port raid (PR). Successful ports raids can be profitable for the attackers, but most ports are heavily defended so don't do this alone.
