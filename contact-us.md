<!-- SUBTITLE: SMR Administration -->

There are several ways to contact the admins of SMR.
1. You can message an admin in-game, those players will have will have a blue Admin tag attached to their name and they can be found on the current players list if they are online. An example of an admin player would be `Lieutenant 2nd Class Hot MaMa (14) Admin`.
2. Another way of contacting the admins is through the contact form in-game on the left side of the page. This is a link that when opened will show an email form where you can send an email to support@smrealms.de through the game.
3. The next way you can contact an admin is through chat. By joining #smr through the IRC link in-game you can message any online admin who is in chat at the time via a personal message by clicking their name. Those online admins will have a ~, & or @ in front of their chat nicknames.
4. The last way you can contact an admin is through the web board. Logging into the web board you can personal message admins there. Their names are colored in red so that they can be easily distinguished. Contacting them is easy, all you need to do is click one of their names and either PM or email them.
