# Politics
Politics and the Ruling Council are often the most overlooked aspect of SMR. Both play a crucial role though, determining the following:
* races you can trade with
* racial weapons you can use
* if racial beacons will protect you

Each racial ruling council is made up of the top five members of that race, ranked by experience. The President of each race is determined by alignment and experience. To become President, you must have the highest experience out of all the council members with alignment over 150. In the case of two council members having the same experience, the one who has the higher alignment will become President.

You can access your race's ruling council by clicking on the trader link on your current sector screen, then clicking on politics. You will be able to view who is on your ruling council, and if you are a member, you will be able to cast your vote for peace/war with other races as well as increase or decrease global relations with another race by 10 each day. The President of the council is the only one who can initiate or veto a vote.
