Internet Relay Chat (IRC or just chat for short)

IRC is the main means of communication for many web based games and communities and SMR is no exception. IRC is the backbone on which team play as well as socializing is done in SMR. While some players do use voice chat / conferencing to run their operations, IRC still remains a crucial element in game-play. It is recommended that whenever you are going to play SMR you check in with your alliance chat room first. Here your fellow team mates can alert you to dangers, advise you of tasks that you might be able to help with, or simply ask that you stay out of the game as to not spook an enemy trader they are trying to hunt.


# Ways of Connecting to IRC

One of the easiest ways of connecting is via the IRC Chat link on the left panel near the bottom. When you click this it will bring up the rules, at the bottom of the rules page is a button to accept. After you accept the rules a new tab or window will be opened and it will ask you for a nickname to use in chat. You can just click connect and it will attach an SMR- prefix to your current game name. This will take you to the game lobby #smr and an alliance chat room if you are currently in an alliance and the leader has set the room under alliance options.
Another web based option which uses the same basic applet as the in-game link uses can be found at www.mibbit.com from here you can select the server we use which is the Coldfront network irc.coldfront.net it will also ask you for a nickname and which channels you would like to join.
There are also 3rd party applications to connect to IRC servers. mIRC, xchat, icechat, pidgin, and colloquy for apple users are the most widely used. If you are familiar with any of these than you can simply connect to irc.theairlock.net using them otherwise a good option is to come to chat using the in-game applet and ask someone for help in setting it up.

# Basic IRC Commands

There are a few basic commands you should know if you have never used IRC before. /join or /j is used to join a new room, room names are generally prefixed by a #. Example: /join #smr will take you to a friendly public room where several SMR players congregate. /nick is used to change your nickname in chat. Example /nick NewNick will change your name to NewNick
More advanced commands include registering your nickname and identifying yourself afterward
/nickserv register password email (where password is the password you would like to use and email is your own valid email address, you will receive an email with instructions on validating it)
/nickserv identify password (where password is the password you set when registered) is used thereafter when you connect or switch to your registered nickname.
Be advised that we are part of a very large IRC network and your preferred name may be registered already.
Other commands are also available via nickserv and chanserv you can get an idea of these by typing /nickserv help and /chanserv help respectively.
